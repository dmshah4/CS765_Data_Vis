# CS765_Data_Vis
FA2021 Data Visualization Design Challenge 2 Project
Tiny Charts Final Design Implementation

This repository holds all the supplemental information for the final submission of DC2. 

There are three sub-folders here. Each sub-folder has it's own README.md file that describes each portion in more detail. The general overview is: 
1. Datasets: This folder holds all 3 datasets I used for this study. All three of these datasets are automatically included in the project tool since the whole directly is cloned and pulled when running. 

2. Evaluation: This folder contains the survey that was built and used for evaluating my project design. The survey (and participant results) are shown in the pdf file found here.

3. Project Implementation: This folder contains the actual command-line tool that was built as a part of this project. The tool is meant for Google Colabs and is thus saved as a .ipynb file format. There are instructions in the README.md file that explain how to load and run this program. 

The final report provides much more detailed information on all three of these folders. It explains the reasoning for each of the decisions made in developing the datasets, the survey, and project implementation. 

A tutorial for how to open and use this command-line tool is found here:
